* Gthor

*Gthor* - [[https://github.com/wycats/thor][Thor]] extension on RubyGem framework

Gthor finds not only Thorfiles by traversing from current directory down to the root, but also =Gthorfile= at the current directory (no traversing) or root of all installed gems, and then enables to exec it as subcommands of =gthor=. So Gthor can manage Thor extensions on RubyGem framework, by =gem= command.

* Installation

: gem install gthor

* Usage

Format of =Gthorfile= is same with Thorfiles, which contain standard ruby code with Thor functionalities. Please see [[https://github.com/wycats/thor/wiki][Thor wiki]] for detailed usages.
